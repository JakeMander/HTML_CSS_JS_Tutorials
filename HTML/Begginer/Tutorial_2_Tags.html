<!-- 
	Introduction to tags. Tags surround content and apply meaning to it.
-->


<!-- 
	<!DOCTYPE html> is a document type declaration! It lets the browser know  
        which flavour of HTML we are using! It's important this goes in the 
        document! Failure to do so results in the browser getting confused about 
        which version we're using!

        <html> is the opening tag. This tells the browser everything between 
        <html> and <!html> is html code.

        Anything contained between <body> and <!body> is the main content of the
        browser window.

        Remember! All tags that enclose content such as <p> need an associated
        closing tag. Single use tags such as <br> (break) do not require
        closing.

        Object To Also Be Aware Of:
        
        -   Attributes - Extra bits of information associated with a tag.
                         Take <tag attribute="value">Margarine</tag> for
                         example. Attributes appear inside the opening tag
                         and are surrounded with quotation marks.
            
        -   Elements -  - Elements are the components that make up webpages. 
                          They are made up of the tags, and all the code that
                          exists between them.

            <title> </title> = Tags.
            <title> HelloWorld </title> = Element.
