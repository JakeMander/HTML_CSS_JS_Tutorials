                Notice how the first set of text displayed is concatenated onto
                a single line in the browser! Browsers do not recognise spaces
                or new lines as a means to insert text onto multiple lines.

            How Exciting
            
            <!-- 
                Use paragraph tags (<p></p>) to move text onto different lines.
                However! Remember that HTML is about the content of the text
                not the presentation! <p></p> signifies a distinct block of
                text is to exist! Not how it is to be formatted!

                <em> Empahsises text. It is equivalent to italics.
                <strong> Prints text in bold.
            
                i and b tags also exist, however, they are not the same!
                
                Remember! HTML is not for presentation! Emphasis should be
                made generally! You can't speak in itallics!

            <p> Yes, that really <em>IS</em> exciting. <strong>WARNING:</strong>
                level of excitement may cause head to explode. </p>

                <br> is a line break! It is used to seperate lines. It doesn't
                use a closing brace (it encloses no content!). 

                Use Sparingly. Seperating text is what <p> is for!

                <br /> Comes from the days of XML which require for all tags to
                be terminated with a closing </>

            <p>
                I am now going to use a line break...<br />
                See... It worked.
